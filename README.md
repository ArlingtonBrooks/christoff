## A Visual Metronome for Linux
This project is intended to fill the gap where existing metronome solutions seem to fail.  
There are metronome solutions which produce an audible tick, and which produce a minimal amount of visual feedback; however, if you are several feet away from your PC or you're playing in a group, this may not be sufficient. 
By having a visual metronome which lights up the whole screen, it's easier for everyone to see.  
In the future, there will also be visualizations so that instead of a static on/off tick, there can be a build-up so that you can anticipate when the beat is coming.  

## Development
I do not have infinite time, so expect development to go at its own pace.
